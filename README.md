Implementation of the stream cipher - RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)

`From Wikipedia`
> The RC4 Encryption Algorithm, developed by Ronald Rivest of RSA, is a shared key stream cipher algorithm requiring a secure exchange of a shared key. The symmetric key algorithm is used identically for encryption and decryption such that the data stream is simply XORed with the generated key sequence.

## How to run:

`Python 2 version`

    $ python2 rc4-2.py

###### To run the tests

    $ python2 -m pytest rc4-2.py

----

`Python 3 version`
